      Through a combination of thorough analysis, and of course some luck, I
      have made a number of successful real estate investments. I have an MBA
      from UC Berkeley, a bachelors in Business Administration and Finance from
      USC, and I have a knack for financial analysis having led merger and
      acquisitions analysis for numerous large tech companies.  All that said, I
      am always looking to improve and grow so am always looking for input on
      how to better improve this tool.
