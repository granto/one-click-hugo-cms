  heading: Why you need this spreadsheet
  text: >-
    I created this spreadsheet to evaluate my investments in rental properties. 
    I looked at the simple rental property calculators and the more advanced
    ones on BiggerPockets, but none of them had sufficient level of detail to
    provide me with an estimated return that I could believe in. Smart investors
    need to be able to see all the assumptions and adjust them to meet their
    needs. The difference between ignoring the tax benefits of a rental property
    or the price appreciation, can make you miss out on what may be a great
    investment.  This spreadsheet gives you that level of control to make the
    right investment decisions.
