  Need a spreadsheet to help you assess a potential investment property?  Have
  you tried the simple online tools that just aren't sophisticated or
  customizable enough for the needs of a real estate investor?

RiffBiz's real estate investment property spreadsheets are Google Sheets that have been built to the needs of the most successful real estate investors.  I looked all over and tried numerous investment property evaluators but they all came up short.  Try the live demo [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i6xNZiNVn53_bnibfEvKeMQi52ueFYMWFjUDUTprFqs/edit?usp=sharing) and see the difference for yourself. Note this demo version will not save your results as they may be overwritten by other users.  If you want your own private version, you can gain access [here](https://riffbiz.com/products).
