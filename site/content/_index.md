  heading: Why you need this spreadsheet
  text: >-
    I created this
    [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i6xNZiNVn53_bnibfEvKeMQi52ueFYMWFjUDUTprFqs/edit?usp=sharing)
    to evaluate my investments in rental properties.  I looked at the simple
    rental property calculators and the more advanced ones on BiggerPockets, but
    none of them had sufficient level of detail to provide me with an estimated
    return that I could believe in. Smart investors need to be able to see all
    the assumptions and adjust them to meet their needs. The difference between
    ignoring the tax benefits of a rental property or the price appreciation,
    can make you miss out on what may be a great investment.  This spreadsheet
    gives you that level of control to make the right investment decisions and
    much more informed position than the vast majority of others.
